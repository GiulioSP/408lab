# Outline Lab 1 - The Michelson Interferometer
##### Ryan Schmidt-23407159

## Objectives:

  - Explore interference patterns from different light sources (HeNe laser, sodium lamp, and white light)
  - Use data from interference pattern to find information about the light sources and beam lengths
  - Use Fourier transform spectroscopy to find wavelengths of light sources

## Tentative Schedule:

### Day 1

- Align Mirrors to view interference pattern on CCD (5.3)
- Calibrate the translation stage (5.4)
- Use the HeNe laser to measure the index of refraction of air (5.5)
- Use the translation stage to find the wavelength of the sodium lamp (5.6)
- 
### Day 2

- Locate the position of zero path length difference which is important for the fourier transform spectroscopy section (5.7)
- Use fourier transform spectroscopy to find the spectrum of each light source(5.8)
-
