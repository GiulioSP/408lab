### Day 1

#### Finding fringes
First we needed to align the mirrors, we used the HeNe laser and the TV screen. Then we adjusted the mirrors till we could see an interference pattern on the screen.

As we adjust the mirror horizontally we see a vertical interference pattern, and when we adjust vertically we see a horizontal pattern. The pattern has the highest spacial frequency when they are not aligned well and when they are aligned the pattern looks like it has a smaller spacial frequency.

After talking to the professor we realized that we should be using the lens in front of the laser, it spreads the beam out so we can see more of the fringes.
